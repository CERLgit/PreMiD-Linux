# Important update!

<h3>For security reasons, we released update 2.2.17 that changes Updater URL from DoomLord's (old linux maintainer) to our official PreMiD repo. To be safe, every Linux user should download AppImage with version 2.2.17 and shouldn't use Arch User Respository version or Debian/Ubuntu repo for now.</h3>

## About

**PreMiD** is a simple, configurable utility that uses Discord's RP ( Rich Presence ) library which allows you to show what you're doing on the web ( and a few programs ) in your Discord profile as **playing status**.

### Requirements

Technically every distribution that can run Discord's [official](https://discordapp.com/download) **app** ( not the web or the snap version ) can run PreMiD too;</br>
As you may have noticed in the recent years, some Linux distributions started dropping support for the 32-bit (ia32/i686/i386/x86) architectures, and as a result, we did too. You can, however, try to build the app yourself if you desperately need to use it on a 32-bit distribution.</br>
Since we currently use Electron as an engine (Discord does too!), its requirements also apply to this app :

- Ubuntu ≥ 12.04
- Fedora ≥ 21
- Debian ≥ 8

It is unknown whether older versions of other distributions support it, so just keep your distribution updated and use **LTS (Long-Term Support)** releases if your distribution offers them, as they're more stable (avoid alpha releases).

## Snapcraft

Probably never, since Snap's nature blocks PreMiD from reaching Discord and the extension properly,</br>
It would be appreciated if someone could do it though, any ideas or PRs are welcome.</br>
P.S.: classic confinement doesn't work either so don't bother making a suggestion about it.

## Portable AppImage

The AppImage package is the recommended one if Discord works for you but other PreMiD packages (.deb, .rpm, etc) don't.

<a name="appimageinstall"></a>

### Installation instructions

```bash
wget https://github.com/PreMiD/Linux/releases/latest/download/PreMiD-Portable.AppImage && chmod a+x PreMiD*.AppImage
```

```bash
# Just double-click it or run
./PreMiD*.AppImage
```

### Additional notes

Either if you want to try PreMiD or just don't want to install it, this one's the best, it's always up to date but _DOESN'T AUTO-START WITH THE SYSTEM!_</br>If you get tired of having to open it each time, use the other packages (according to your distribution).

# PackageCloud

We released deb/rpm packages at our packagecloud repo. Please visit it at https://packagecloud.io/PreMiD/Linux and download your deb/rpm package or use automatic script.

For **Ubuntu/Debian** repo:

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/PreMiD/Linux/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```

For **Fedora/CentOS/RedHat**:

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/PreMiD/Linux/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
